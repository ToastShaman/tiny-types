# Test Desiderata

STARTER_CHARACTER = 📋🧪

Analyse and improve tests using Kent Beck's Test Desiderata framework — 12 properties that make tests more valuable.

## Analysis Workflow

Analyse tests by:

1. **Read the test code** — understand what's being tested and how
2. **Evaluate against principles** — assess each relevant Test Desiderata property
3. **Identify tradeoffs** — note where properties conflict or support each other
4. **Prioritise improvements** — focus on high-impact issues first
5. **Suggest specific changes** — provide concrete, actionable recommendations

## The 12 Test Desiderata Properties

These properties make tests more valuable. Some support each other, some interfere, and sometimes properties only *seem* to interfere — that's where design improvements help.

### 1. Isolated
Tests return the same results regardless of execution order. Tests don't depend on shared state, previous test results, or external ordering.

**Issues to detect:**
- Shared mutable state between tests
- Tests that must run in specific order
- Setup/teardown that affects other tests
- Database state dependencies

### 2. Composable
Test different dimensions of variability separately and combine results. Break complex scenarios into independent, reusable test components.

**Issues to detect:**
- Monolithic tests covering multiple concerns
- Inability to test dimensions independently
- Duplicated test setup across related tests
- Tests that can't be combined or reused

### 3. Deterministic
If nothing changes, test results don't change. No randomness, timing dependencies, or environmental variations.

**Issues to detect:**
- Random data generation
- Time-dependent assertions
- Flaky tests that pass/fail intermittently
- Network or external service dependencies

### 4. Fast
Tests run quickly, enabling frequent execution during development.

**Issues to detect:**
- Slow database operations
- Unnecessary sleep/wait calls
- Heavy file I/O
- External service calls
- Inefficient test data setup

### 5. Writable
Tests are cheap to write relative to the code being tested. Low friction for adding new tests.

**Issues to detect:**
- Excessive boilerplate
- Complex test setup
- Hard-to-understand test frameworks
- Difficult mocking/stubbing

### 6. Readable
Tests are comprehensible and invoke the motivation for writing them. Clear intent and behavior.

**Issues to detect:**
- Unclear test names
- Complex assertions without explanation
- Missing context about "why"
- Obscure test data
- Poor structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)

### 7. Behavioral
Tests are sensitive to behavior changes. If behavior changes, test results change.

**Issues to detect:**
- Tests that pass despite broken functionality
- Assertions that check implementation details only
- Insufficient coverage of edge cases
- Missing assertions on outcomes

### 8. Structure-insensitive
Tests don't change when code structure changes (refactoring doesn't break tests).

**Issues to detect:**
- Tests coupled to internal implementation
- Mocking private methods
- Assertions on internal state
- Tests breaking during refactoring despite unchanged behavior

### 9. Automated
Tests run without human intervention. No manual steps or verification required.

**Issues to detect:**
- Manual verification steps
- Console output requiring human inspection
- Interactive prompts
- Manual data setup

### 10. Specific
When tests fail, the cause is obvious. Failures point directly to the problem.

**Issues to detect:**
- Generic error messages
- Multiple assertions per test
- Tests covering too much functionality
- Unclear failure output

### 11. Predictive
If all tests pass, code is suitable for production. Tests catch issues before deployment.

**Issues to detect:**
- Missing critical scenarios
- Insufficient integration testing
- Gaps in error handling coverage
- Production-only configurations not tested

### 12. Inspiring
Passing tests inspire confidence in the system. Comprehensive coverage of important behaviors.

**Issues to detect:**
- Trivial tests that don't verify meaningful behavior
- Low coverage of critical paths
- Missing tests for known edge cases
- Tests that don't reflect real usage

## Tradeoff Analysis

Properties can support, interfere, or only seem to interfere with each other.

**Supporting properties:**
- Isolated + Deterministic → More reliable tests
- Fast + Automated → More frequent execution
- Readable + Specific → Easier debugging

**Interfering properties:**
- Predictive + Fast → Comprehensive tests are often slower
- Fast + Isolated → Complete isolation may require more setup
- Writable + Predictive → Simple tests may not catch all issues

**Only seeming to interfere (design opportunities):**
- Use Composable to make tests both Fast AND Predictive
- Break monolithic tests into focused ones (Specific + Fast)
- Smart test fixtures enable Writable + Isolated

## Prioritising Improvements

Focus improvements in this order:

1. **Safety issues** — fix Isolated and Deterministic first (flaky tests erode trust)
2. **Feedback loop** — improve Fast to enable frequent testing
3. **Maintainability** — enhance Readable and Structure-insensitive for long-term health
4. **Confidence** — strengthen Predictive and Inspiring for production readiness

Not all properties need perfect scores. Optimise for the tradeoffs that matter most for the specific codebase and team.

## Recommendation Format

Provide improvements with:

1. **Be specific** — point to exact code locations
2. **Explain the principle** — reference which Test Desiderata property is violated
3. **Show the impact** — describe why it matters
4. **Suggest concrete fixes** — provide actionable code examples
5. **Note tradeoffs** — acknowledge when improvements conflict with other properties

Example:
```
Issue: Test "test_user_creation" violates Isolated property
Location: Line 45 — shares database connection across tests
Impact: Test results depend on execution order, causing intermittent failures
Fix: Use fresh database connection per test with proper cleanup
Tradeoff: Slightly slower but much more reliable
```
